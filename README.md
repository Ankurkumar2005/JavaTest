## 📖 Introduction

This guide aims to provide Java developers with the skills and tools required to implement microservices architecture effectively. By following this guide, you will learn:

- How to build loosely coupled, scalable services.
- Integrating microservices with REST, gRPC, and messaging systems.
- Best practices for deployment and monitoring.

---

## 🌟 Why Microservices?

- **Scalability**: Scale individual services independently.
- **Resilience**: Minimize the impact of failures through service isolation.
- **Flexibility**: Adopt different technologies for different services.
- **Faster Deployment**: Continuous delivery for individual components.

---

## 🛠 Key Concepts

- **Service Design**: Define clear boundaries and responsibilities for each service.
- **Communication**: Use REST APIs, gRPC, and messaging systems like Kafka.
- **Data Management**: Embrace database per service; use eventual consistency.
- **Service Discovery**: Implement dynamic service registry using tools like Eureka.
- **Monitoring**: Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for observability.

## 🧰 Technologies and Tools

### Backend Frameworks
- Spring Boot (Spring Cloud for Microservices)
- Quarkus or Micronaut (Lightweight frameworks)

### Communication
- REST APIs
- gRPC
- Message Queues: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka

### Databases
- Relational: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- NoSQL: MongoDB, Cassandra

### Service Discovery
- Netflix Eureka
- Consul
- Kubernetes DNS

### Security
- OAuth2 and JWT Authentication
- API Gateway: Spring Cloud Gateway or Kong

### Observability
- Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana
- Distributed Tracing: Jaeger, Zipkin

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 11 or higher
- Build Tools: Maven or Gradle
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Kubernetes (Optional for container orchestration)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-microservices.git
cd java-microservices
```

### Running Locally

#### Start Service Registry
1. Navigate to `service-registry`.
2. Run the service:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

#### Start Microservices
Repeat the process for each service (e.g., `user-service`, `order-service`).

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

#### Run API Gateway
Navigate to `api-gateway` and start it:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
